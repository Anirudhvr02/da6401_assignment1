# FeedForward Neural Network with Backpropagation from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a feedforward neural network built entirely from scratch with backpropagation. The project also integrates hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking via Weights & Biases (WandB).

## Overview

- **Task:** Build a feedforward neural network with backpropagation.
- **Tracking:** Experiment results are logged on [WandB Project](https://wandb.ai/anirudhvr02-indian-institute-of-technology-madras/DA6401_Assignment1/reports/DA6401-Assignment-1--VmlldzoxMTgzNzEwMQ) and detailed in the [WandB Report](https://wandb.ai/anirudhvr02-indian-institute-of-technology-madras/DA6401_Assignment1/reports/DA6401-Assignment-1--VmlldzoxMTgzNzEwMQ)
